* Possibly referencing 支那そば たかはし, a ramen shop that started selling "half half fried rice" in 2021. 
"Half fried rice" is half the normal portion, and usually sold with other foodstuffs as a set.
This shop's "Half half" on the other hand is actually equivalent to 3 normal portions, but still sold in a set.
